             <h3>Gowtham GM</h3>
             <pre>A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team.I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student.
joined Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month of February. My journey with Tap Academy is quite different. 
The trainers at Tap Academy are skilled and experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts and help in learning 
programming languages from scratch.
I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap Academy is structured in a way that makes it easy 
for students from all domains to understand the concepts and technology taught by the trainers.
 Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package of 3.25 LPA. </pre>

 <h3>Gagan GR</h3>
 <pre>After joining Tap Academy, I have improved my programming skills, and my knowledge of core Java has also improved.
 Now, I am learning the Collection Framework, MySQL, HTML, and CSS in parallel. Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced
 my problem-solving skills. Additionally, the LMS makes it easy to watch all the recorded videos. They also provide recorded
 videos of frameworks like J2EE, Spring, Data Structures, etc.
 I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role of Associate Technical Consultant with a package of 3 LPA.</pre>
